# Raisin Class Prediction Project

## Overview
This project focuses on building machine learning models to predict the class of raisins based on various features such as size, color, texture, etc.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the famous Raisin dataset, which contains information about different types of raisins and their characteristics. The dataset is available in the file `raisin_data.csv`.

## Files
- `Raisin_Dataset.xlsx`: The dataset containing information about different types of raisins.
- `Capstone Project-2 (Raisin_Class_Prediction).ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis, exploratory data analysis (EDA), outlier analysis, visualization, and building machine learning models.

## Data Analysis
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the structure and characteristics of the dataset.
- Outlier analysis is conducted to identify and handle outliers in the data.
- Various other analyses are conducted to gain insights into the dataset.

## Machine Learning Models
- Machine learning models are built using various algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, etc.
- Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize the performance of the models.

## Results
- The performance of the machine learning models is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.
- The predictions of the models are compared with actual raisin classes to assess their effectiveness.
